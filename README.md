CuB3D
Welcome to CuB3D! This project is a part of the 42 curriculum, designed to provide a hands-on learning experience in 3D graphics and game development. CuB3D is a 3D raycasting engine inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D, and it aims to help students understand the fundamentals of rendering, game physics, and user interaction in a 3D space.

About CuB3D
CuB3D is a minimalistic 3D engine that leverages raycasting techniques to create immersive 3D environments. By focusing on core concepts such as raycasting, texture mapping, and user input, CuB3D provides a solid foundation for understanding how 3D games and simulations work. This project is designed to be both a learning tool and a platform for experimentation, allowing students to dive into the complexities of 3D graphics in a manageable scope.

Key Features
Raycasting Engine: Utilize raycasting to render 3D scenes from 2D map data, mimicking the behavior of early 3D games.
Simple Physics: Implement basic physics for player movement and collision detection.
Texture Mapping: Apply textures to surfaces to create a more realistic visual experience.
User Interaction: Handle user inputs for controlling the player character and interacting with the environment.
Modular Design: Easily extend and modify the engine to explore advanced features and customizations.
Purpose
CuB3D is developed as part of the 42 curriculum to provide students with practical experience in:

3D rendering techniques and their underlying mathematics.
Game loop mechanics and state management.
Optimizing performance for real-time applications.
By working on CuB3D, students gain valuable insights into the principles of game development and 3D graphics, preparing them for more complex projects and real-world applications.
